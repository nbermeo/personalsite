                    <p>Emily is a 32 year old woman. She has Celiac's so she cannot have any gluten in her diet. She wants to be able to make meals that would not only feed her, but enjoy making. She usually would buy ready made freezer meals but she wants to cook more often.<br /><br />She works full time and sometimes has to work long hours. She is interested in meal prepping to save some time and energy.</p>

                    <div>
                        I created a quick sketch using the “Crazy-Eights” exercise. Some solutions that I came up with were:
                        <!-- TODO: Style it better -->
                        <ul>
                            <li>Listing tools at hand.</li>
                            <li>Choosing main and sides for their meals.</li>
                            <li>Choosing recipes based on ingredients they already have.</li>
                            <li>Changing serving sizes of recipes.</li>
                            <li>Listing allergies in user profile.</li>
                            <li>Adding diet restrictions.</li>
                            <li>Listing goals.</li>
                            <li>Step by step instructions while cooking.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class="project__title">Wire-framing</h2>
                <img src="./images/prepper-wireframes-1.png" alt="wireframe" />
                <p>I wanted the mobile wireframes to reflect a more “on-the-go” and “quick” views of recipes and calendar. Emily would be able to view and edit hew meal preps when she has a quick break from work.</p>
                <img src="./images/prepper-wireframes-2.png" alt="wireframe" />
                <p>I created these desktop wireframes for the users that prefer to be able to sit down and thoroughly plan their meals. Emily will be able to seamlessly look through recipes and join communities based on preferences. Desktop view will be able to allow her to be able to look at her weekly menu in detail such as nutritional facts.</p>

                <h2 class="project__title">Prototyping</h2>

                    <img class="phone-radius proto-item" loading="lazy" src="./images/prepper-prototype-1.gif" alt="prepper-proto" />
                    <p class="proto-item">Emily can now view and add recipes for her meal preps from her mobile phone. She can even view the featured recipe based on her preferences and restrictions. She can confidently view all the recipes knowing that it wont flare her Celiac's.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project__row">
                    <p class="proto-item">She can also plan her meals if she chooses to use her desktop computer. I also understand that while some users like to be able to use their desktops when doing any form of planning.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="project__title">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>I have learned so much when it comes to wireframing and prototyping, I'm really pleased with the outcome. I would love to be able to build this application and website with a developer and be able to get feedback from established users.</p>

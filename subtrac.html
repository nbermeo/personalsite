                        <li>Figure B: I got some great ideas such as using pie and line graphs, using the same email from sign-in, and a end-of-year wrap that was inspired by Spotify wrap.</li>
                        <li>Figure C: I thought of a renewal warning and an email search. There were also some fun ideas like a juggler game based on all the subscriptions that the user has added.</li>

                    <p>The homepage of Subtrac shows upcoming payments and graphs. After researching, I decided to change the bell curve graph with bar graphs, since bell-curve graphs is helpful for data like testing scores. Also, bar graphs are much more simple to show Adam how much he have been spending.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project__row">
                    <p>I also made an easy way for Adam to add his subscriptions from just providing an email. All he would have to do is press the plus icon and log in. I got this idea from using Mint for my own personal use.</p>

                <h2 class="project__title">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>By just working on this by myself, I was able to get some very helpful user feedback and ideate based on a simple Google survey. If given a chance, I would love to be able to add the features of Subtrac to an established application with a dedicated team of experienced designers. I had a solid idea of how to help people like Adam, but would love to be able to seek feedback from designers and test in different stages.</p>

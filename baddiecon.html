I designed the entire website from scratch, using visuals from the Graphic Designer, copy from the UX Writer, and stakeholder feedback. The conference, run by Baddies In Tech, was created to empower women of color and allies to develop their professional careers and give them a space to network. This 2nd annual event included expos, panels, and workshops to help our attendees grow their skills and build connections in the tech industry.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Project meetings began in March. The conference was in August so we were already on a time crunch! I previously worked with Baddies in Tech for their 2024 Buildathon, so I had some working demographic data to start building on. To keep track of feedback requests, I maintained a work diary with important meetings, work tasks, and suggestions.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p><i>(I kept short, but detailed notes of meetings, tasks, and requests)</i></p>

                </div>
                <p>I studied other tech conferences and their websites to pull inspiration and best practices. What ideas could I take, and what elements could I improve on? I knew I didn't need to reinvent the wheel but if I could deliver the best version of the wheel that would be a win in my book. The first site that caught my attention was INBOUND.</p>

                            Nicole is an exceptionally talented and dedicated UX Designer. During our time together at Baddies in Tech, she consistently impressed me with her ability to translate complex feedback and project requirements into innovative and user-centric designs. Her rapid turnaround times and eagerness to learn are truly remarkable, and it has been a pleasure witnessing her growth as a designer. Nicole's empathetic nature and collaborative spirit make her a joy to work with, and she consistently fosters a positive and supportive team environment. She is an invaluable asset to
                            any team, bringing a unique combination of technical expertise, creative vision, and unwavering dedication to her work. I wholeheartedly recommend Nicole for any UX Design role.

                            I had the pleasure of working with Nicole on a 0-to-1 project, where we built a member portal for Baddies in Tech through Tech Fleet. As a co-lead on the UX design team, I had the opportunity to mentor Nicole, who joined our team later in the process as one of our apprentices.Despite joining the team later, Nicole quickly gelled with everyone, integrating seamlessly into our workflow. She was incredibly receptive to feedback and always approached each task with a willingness to learn and grow. Nicole brought unique and fresh perspectives to our design discussions,
                            which enriched the overall quality of our work.Her ability to be both a great team player and an insightful UX designer made her an asset to the team. Nicole consistently contributed valuable ideas and demonstrated a strong commitment to the project's success. It was a pleasure mentoring her, and I'm confident she will continue to excel in her UX design career.

                        <p class="testimonial__text">I worked with Nicole for the Baddies in Tech Buildathon website. Nicole created high-fidelity mockups in Figma that made it easy for me as a developer to implement in Webflow. She brought the "Y2K futuristic" theme to life in a beautiful way and created different designs for each page, while keeping them cohesive. Nicole was also very receptive to feedback and was quick to make changes. It was a pleasure working with her and I would highly recommend her for any UX/Design roles!</p>

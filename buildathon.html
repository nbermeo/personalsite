                <p class="project__text-small">I was responsible for designing the very first virtual Hackathon focusing on Women's Rights. I originally took over for the previous designer when it was still in the ideating and creating low fidelity wireframes for the landing page. Since this was a unique event, I had to be creative and innovating while working with a cross-functional team of designers and engineers. By the end of the Buildathon, we had 235 Participants.</p>

                        <p>First version of events page for desktop and mobile. The layout works, but text was tricky to read, which we did change for a more readable color later. I also tweaked the filter so there was only a few pills and moved the events to the top of the events boxes.</p>

                <p>
                    This was my very first project where I collaborated with a cross-functional team and have a live website. I learned a lot about communication consistency, receiving and implementing feedback from my team, and working with developers to create a fully functioning website. I also learned the important of having a stronger designer voice and having more confidence in my mockups and I can't wait to create more websites. With the very first virtual Buildathon, we had a great turnout. I am proud to be able to set up a foundation for the next following Buildathons and I can't wait
                    to see what the future holds.
